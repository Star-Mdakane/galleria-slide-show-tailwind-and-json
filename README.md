## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slideshow and view each painting in a lightbox

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
1. My planning was that...Initially I looked at the layout and came out with its design.
- The header was simple, nothing complicated
2. I then came to the gallery. I thought if I should use a div with buttons on an ul but decided on the ul.
- Initially palcig a pic on the gallery I thought I would bring it in via fetch but seeing it containing different sizes I had to make it independentl.
- Comes the hard part but I thought it was simple. Used grid on mobile display and it was perfect. Moving on to larger screens came with the white spaces. 
- I attempted many things to to clear the white space including grid-auto-rows, changed the layout to flex, even experimental grid masonry to no avail. The closest was ccolumn but it had its flaw of not allowing me to move it in a particulr direction or order but I chose it since it was the closest to the solution.
3. I then moved to the gallery screen.Straight forward design but it needs you to take you time and be patient or you will come up wih silly errors.
4. I encountered no challenges from designing one screen size to another.
5. Designing the slideshow I first had to design the image title and autor name whereby I thought I would use negative margin but I had to settle for absolute position.
6. The year I also had to make absolute while the description was static in the content box. 
7. Sliideshow button was simple.
8. The buttons were a bit complicated since I had to move some props on the functions while selecting the parent group was a nightmare.
9. The slider gave me a bit of a run around. I tried addinng the bckground via javascript and upodate the class. Went around in that vain till I decided to simplify everything.
